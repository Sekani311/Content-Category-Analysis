### Insight

From our analysis, we see that there is a total of 16 unique content categories. Animals and Science are the two most popular content categories with Animal ranking first in the list. This shows the interest of users in content that gives information on reality and fictional events. We have also shown the percentage distribution of scores within the top 5 category of content.

### Recommendation

Through our analysis, we tackled this task and found the ***top 5*** most popular categories as required. We also found that ***Animals*** and ***Science*** are the two most popular categories, suggesting that users like ***real-life*** and ***factual*** content. The highest post engagements were made in the month of ***May*** and other months like ***January*** and ***August*** had a relatively good amounts of post engagement.

In business terms, this could suggest that the most popular category, ***Animals***, is tailing away from the rest of the categories and may continue to get more and more popular. To avoid an issue where one content category consumes the entire platform, it will be important for you to ensure that any algorithms used to govern the content on the platform gives a fair balance to the content categories. 

We also found that food was a common theme amongst popular content and the most popular food category was healthy eating. This could be a signal to show the types of people that are using your platform, and you could use this insight to boost engagement even further. For example, you could run a campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating brands to promote content.
